# 1.ATM 
# Pooja would like to withdraw X $US from an ATM. The cash machine will only accept the transaction if X is a multiple of 5, and Pooja's account balance has enough cash to perform the withdrawal transaction (including bank charges). For each successful withdrawal the bank charges 0.50 $US. Calculate Pooja's account balance after an attempted transaction.

# Input
# Positive integer 0 < X <= 2000 - the amount of cash which Pooja wishes to withdraw.
# Nonnegative number 0<= Y <= 2000 with two digits of precision - Pooja's initial account balance.

# Output
# Output the account balance after the attempted transaction, given as a number with two digits of precision. If there is not enough money in the account to complete the transaction, output the current bank balance.

# Example â€“ Successful Transaction
# Input:
# 30 120.00

# Output:
# 89.50

# Example - Incorrect Withdrawal Amount (not multiple of 5)
# Input:
# 42 120.00

# Output:
# 120.00

# Example - Insufficient Funds
# Input:
# 300 120.00

# Output:
# 120.00
